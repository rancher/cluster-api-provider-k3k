# capi-k3k

A Cluster API provider for [K3k](https://github.com/rancher/k3k).

## Description

This project allows the provisioning and management of K3k clusters using [CAPI](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following specify the minimum version requirement of each component:

- Go v1.22
- Docker v24
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster v1.25
- Tilt v0.33.11
- Helm v3.12.0

### Run from development branch

Follow the [upstream docs](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/tilt) to run the project locally. The basic steps:

#### Install [Tilt](https://tilt.dev)

#### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

Any cluster should work. For quick local tests, Kind and K3d are recommended.

#### Create a local Docker container registry

This is necessary to avoid pushing to a remote repo frequently.

For K3d:

```bash
k3d registry create --port 51111 # Or use a different port.
```

#### Create a cluster using the registry

```bash
k3d cluster create --registry-use $CONTAINER_NAME:$PORT
```

#### Configure the project to use the local registry

Ensure you have GNU sed in your PATH.

```bash
make configure-local TEST_IMAGE=$CONTAINER_NAME:PORT/controller:latest
```

#### Clone the upstream [CAPI](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) project

In your local copy of the project, paste the following into `tilt-settings.yaml`:

```yaml
provider_repos:
  - ../cluster-api-provider-k3k
enable_providers:
  - k3k
allowed_contexts:
  - k3d-k3s-default
kustomize_substitutions:
  CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: "true"
```

The last two lines are only necessary if testing using cluster classes.

Some notes:

- The above assumes that the upstream CAPI project is in the same folder as the cluster-api-provider-k3k project. If
  that isn't true, adjust the path in `provider_repos`.
- `allowed_contexts` controls which kubeconfig contexts Tilt is able to use to deploy resources.
  This needs to point to a context for an admin account on the cluster. You may need to change this value depending on
  your current kubeconfig contents.

#### In the local copy of the CAPI upstream project, run Tilt

```bash
tilt up
```

Most code changes will cause Tilt to automatically rebuild the Go binary, rebuild the Docker image
and push it to the local registry.
However, if you are changing values related to RBAC configuration or CRD fields, you may need to do the following:

- Stop Tilt
- In this project's repo, regenerate the CRDs and manifests (`make generate && make manifests`)
- Start Tilt again

## Project Distribution

TODO: This project is in an unreleased, alpha state. As of now, there are no releases, or a supported way to install the
project other than the dev setup documented above.

## Contributing

All changes should have an issue attached to them, and should have tests (where appropriate).
